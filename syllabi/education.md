# CMPM 118 / Neuromorphic Computing Group / Education Group Syllabus 
Syllabus for the education portion of CMPM 118 w/ Prof. Jason Eshraghian
## Course Description
This course provides an introduction to deep learning from the perspective of undergraduate research. It emphasizes theoretical understanding, analysis, teamwork, and research skills. By the end of this course, students will be equipped to meaningfully contribute to an undergraduate lab at UCSC with a focus on AI research.

**Instructors:** Skye Gunasekaran (akgunase@ucsc.edu) & Jason Eshraghian (jsn@ucsc.edu)

**Location & Time:** 5:20-6:55pm Tuesday @ Engineering 2 Room 194

* Tuesdays: In-Class Lectures \& Coding Session
* Thursdays: Self-guided Project Sessions

## Course Outcomes 

* Grasp the theory behind neural networks, optimization, and modern architectures.
* Implement and train deep learning models using PyTorch.
* Collaborate on a final research project, culminating in a contribution to the lab.

## Suggested Prerequisites 

* CSE 30
* MATH 21
* MATH 23A
* STAT 131 
* or equivalent courses

## Grading

* **Homework (30%):** Bi-weekly coding assignments in PyTorch based on selected class material.
* **Weekly Quizzes (30%):** Due at the end of each week, will test your comprehension of the reading materials and lecture slides. 
* **Final Project & Presentation (40%):** A flexible experience consisting of either a coding challenge (e.g., on Kaggle), a novel research project with the goal of publication, or contribute to open-source by creating a tutorial or tool.

## Diversity and Inclusion

All members of this class are expected to contribute to a respectful, welcoming and inclusive environment for every other member of the class.

## Accommodations for Students with Disabilities

UC Santa Cruz is committed to creating an academic environment that supports its diverse student body. If you are a student with a disability who requires accommodations to achieve equal access in this course, please affiliate with the DRC. I encourage all students to benefit from learning more about DRC services to contact DRC by phone at 831-459-2089 or by email at drc@ucsc.edu. For students already affiliated, make sure that you have requested Academic Access Letters, where you intend to use accommodations. You can also request to meet privately with me by appointment, as soon as possible. I would like us to discuss how we can implement your accommodations in this course to ensure your access and full engagement in this course.

## Support for Students with Other Difficulties

While we sincerely hope that you will be able to pursue your studies peacefully and worry-free, we are aware that in some cases difficulties happen that are beyond your control. You should always feel free and comfortable to bring up any problem with the instructor, but if this is not sufficient, or if you prefer professional help, here are several campus resources that you may want to consider contacting:

* **UC Care** which is a confidential space to discuss issues of dating violence, sexual assault and stalking.
* **Slug Support** where you can ask for help on many practical issues, including dealing with a financial crisis, problems with your living situation, computers, books, etc.
* **CAPS**, which provides counseling and psychological services to students.

## Academic Integrity
All members of the UCSC community have a responsibility to foster an environment of trust, honesty, fairness, respect, and responsibility. All members of the university community are expected to present as their original work only that which is truly their own. Plagiarism of any kind is unacceptable. Violations of the Academic Integrity policy can result in dismissal from the university and a permanent notation on a studentâ€™s transcript. For the full policy and disciplinary procedures on academic dishonesty, refer to the Academic Integrity page

## AI Use Policy
We encourage using Large Language Models (LLMs) as a study aid to explore and understand the course material. For the final project, you may use AI tools for brainstorming, outlining, and checking grammar. However, the core analysis, writing, and conclusions must be your own. The use of AI to generate solutions for homework problems or to write substantive portions of your final project is strictly prohibited and will be treated as an academic integrity violation.
