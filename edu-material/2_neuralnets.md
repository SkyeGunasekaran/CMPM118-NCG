# Neural Networks 101

## Background

Neural networks are perhaps the most powerful machine learning models out there. They were only popularized since around 2013, which is incredibly fresh when you compare it to century-old theory in math/physics. The recency is because of the perfect timing of a few things:

* The ridic amount of data available now. Across the internet, mobile devices, and social media.
* The ridic amount of computational power (especially in GPUs)
* The fact that neural networks are highly parallelizable algorithms, and the fact that GPUs are very good at highly parallelizable workloads.

* Choose your library of choice. PyTorch is far more popular in research. Tensorflow is *slightly* more popular in production environments. I'd recommend PyTorch.

Note that Andrew Ng's Deep Learning playlists above were made quite a while ago. Some minor things are outdated. But it is still very useful to know the trajectory of the field in the past decade.
