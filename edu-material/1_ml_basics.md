# ML Basics â€” Starter Kit

## Background

Machine Learning is all about building programs that learn from data. This first week is for you to catch up on some basic, foundational skills.

## Make sure you know your options for a coding/development environment
* [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) is a nice, quickstart environment for you to start coding in a `notebook' environment.
* These notebooks are wonderful for education, but in practice, large-scale projects will use a dedicated development environment.
* [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a popular one. [YouTube tutorial](https://youtu.be/6i3e-j3wSf0?si=tr3qwXEtdr-hiTwM)
* Learn how to create virtual environments in VSCode, and use them. 

## Get used to GitHub
* [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjZcfj8yxE)
* There are only a few commands you'll commonly use (e.g., push, pull, clone, add). P chill.

## Get used to Python
I mean, sure, ChatGPT is pretty good at Python too. 
I encourage you all to try and learn without ChatGPT first, and then use it if you're really stuck - but make sure you understand the fix.

## Optional viewing
There are many different techniques in machine learning. We tend to focus on neural networks in our course, but if you want to become a pro, it's important to understand classical techniques too. My personal favourite course on classical machine learning comes from Kilian Weinberger: [YouTube lecture series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLl8OlHZGYOQ7bkVbuRthEsaLr7bONzbXS).
