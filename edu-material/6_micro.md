# Microelectronics 101

tl;dr: Neural networks are great. We build them using code. But they'd be nothing without CPUs, GPUs, and other hardware accelerators. So far, we've explored how we might improve the software of neural networks. But ultimately, the brain is a squishy, physical thing. That is to say, the brain is a physical manifestation of the neural code. That's pretty awesome. But it also means that software isn't the only thing we can optimize. We should probably build better hardware, or something. We'll learn about transistors, microelectronics, and how electrons compute.
