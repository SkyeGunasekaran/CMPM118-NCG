# Training Neural Networks

## Background

You should have already gone through the details of training neural networks in the videos from last week - this week is to just get more comfortable with it. 

## Neural Networks 102
* [Neural Networks and Deep Learning Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkDaE6sCZn6Ec-XTbcX1uRg2_u4xOEky0) - You should have watched this already, but for a recap: Videos 9-16, 32-34, 41
* [Improving Neural Networks Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkDaE6sCZn6Hn0vK8co82zjQtt3T2Nkqc) - At the very least, watch Videos 10, 20-23.
* [3Blue1Brown Neural Networks Playlist: Videos 2-4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk&list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi&ab_channel=3Blue1Brown)


## Optional viewing
* [Structuring Machine Learning Projects](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkDaE6sCZn6E7jZ9sN_xHwSHOdjUxUW_b) - At the very least, watch Videos  1,5,6,19

On a final note to neural networks, these YouTube videos provide a rather basic background only. If you wish to dive into the math, some more chunky resources include:

* [CS229 - Machine Learning Full Course @ Stanford](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rMiGQp3WXShtMGgzqpfVfbU)
