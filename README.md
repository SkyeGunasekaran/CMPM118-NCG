# CMPM 118 (NCG) - Collaborative Research Experiences in the Neuromorphic Computing Group


## Course Overview

To ensure all students are on the right path, we have structured the course into different tracks based on experience and goals:

* **Educational Track:** This is the starting point for all new students. In this track, you will build a foundational understanding of deep learning and its core principles through a structured curriculum. The goal is to equip you with the knowledge and skills necessary to potentially transition into a research group in the future.
* **Research Track:** This track is for returning students who are already part of a research group or have been invited to join one. Students in this track will focus on their specific research projects with their assigned mentor.
